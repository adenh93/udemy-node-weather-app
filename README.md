# udemy-node-weather-app
A repository to follow along with the Weather App example in https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/

URL to deployed app on Heroku: https://aher93-weather-application.herokuapp.com/

This repo depends on secret keys/auth tokens for the APIs provided by Mapbox and Darksky. As I won't be exposing my own secret keys, you will need to fetch your own from each service and place them into a .env file in the root of the project in order to connect to the API.
